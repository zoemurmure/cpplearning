data abstraction, inheritance, dynamic binding



virtual:

The base class defines as `virtual` those functions it expects its derived classes to override.

Any non`static` member function, other than a constructor, may be virtual.

`virtual` keyword appears only on the declaration inside the class and may not be used on a function definition that appears outside the class body.

`virtual` function in base class is implicitly `virtual` in the derived classes as well.

must define every virtual function, regardless of whether it is used.



pure virtual:

specify a virtual function is a pure virtual by writing `= 0` in place of a function body



final:

we can prevent a class from being used as a base by following the class name with `final`

any attempt to override a function that has been defined as `final` will be flagged as a error



protected

a class use `protected` for those members that it is willing to share with its derived classes but want to protect from general access

a derived class member or friend may access the `protected` members of the base class *only* **through a derived object**. The derived class has no special access to the `protected` members of base-class objects



derivation access specifier is to control the access that users of the derived class



a derived class may provide a `using` declaration only for names it is permitted to access



for any given point in your code, if a `public` member of the base class would be accessible, then the derived-to-base conversion is also accessible, and not otherwise.
