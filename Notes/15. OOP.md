data abstraction, inheritance, dynamic binding



virtual:

The base class defines as `virtual` those functions it expects its derived classes to override.

Any non`static` member function, other than a constructor, may be virtual.

`virtual` keyword appears only on the declaration inside the class and may not be used on a function definition that appears outside the class body.

`virtual` function in base class is implicitly `virtual` in the derived classes as well.

must define every virtual function, regardless of whether it is used.



final:

we can prevent a class from being used as a base by following the class name with `final`

any attempt to override a function that has been defined as `final` will be flagged as a error
